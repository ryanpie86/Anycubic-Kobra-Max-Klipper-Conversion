# Anycubic-Kobra-Max-Klipper-Conversion

**You will need to remove resistor R66 on your circuit board and place it in R65 spot
Please see https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/ynvbj0/anycubic_kobra_working_config for detailed information**

The printer this has been configured for is stock minus just some Capricorn tubing (and of course the Klipper conversion)

I have tried to credit everyone for the information I have gathered in the printer.cfg. If you feel I have missed something, please do say so.

Also uploaded is a Cura project file containing my optimized 0.2 PLA+ slicer profile, and of course a Cali Cat sitting in it. Import the project into Cura as a new profile.

Oh, and no, your screen will not work after this. After you flash and get the 4 beeps the screen will freeze. Wait a few seconds, power the machine off, and then disconnect the screen. You won't be needing that where you're headed.
