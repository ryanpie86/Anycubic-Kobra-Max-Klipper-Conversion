# Anycubic-Kobra-Max-Klipper-Conversion
My trials and tribulations on converting my Kobra Max

The printer this has been configured for is stock minus just some Capricorn tubing (and of course the Klipper conversion)

I have tried to credit everyone for the information I have gathered in the printer.cfg. If you feel I have missed something, please do say so.

Also uploaded is a Cura project file containing my optimized 0.2 PLA+ slicer profile, and of course a Cali Cat sitting in it. Import the project into Cura as a new profile.
